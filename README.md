# FCFS Scheduling
First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. This is managed with a FIFO queue. The full form of FCFS is First Come First Serve.

## Working
Asks the user to enter number of processes their names and burst time. If the process have different arrival timing then it will also asks for their arrival timing. After that it will calculate their waiting time and turn around time. On the basis of which it will calculate average waiting and turn around time.
